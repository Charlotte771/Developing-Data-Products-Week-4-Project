```r
The codes for the user interface and the server can be found using the following link: https://github.com/Charlotte771/Developing-Data-Products-Week-4-Project
```


## Slide with Bullets

- These codes can be used to create a graph where the number of assaults that occur in a place can be predicted based on the number of murders.

## Dataset Used for the App

```{r arrests, echo = TRUE}
USArrests
```

## Slide with User Interface Code
```r
library(shiny)
shinyUI(fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Predict Assaults from Murders"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("sliderMurder", "What is the number of murders?", 0, 10, value = 10),
            checkboxInput("showModel1", "Show/Hide Model 1", value = TRUE),
            checkboxInput("showModel2", "Show/Hide Model 2", value = TRUE)
        ),
        mainPanel(
            plotOutput("plot1"),
            h3("Predicted Assaults from Model 1:"),
            textOutput("pred1"),
            h3("Predicted Assaults from Model 2:"),
            textOutput("pred2")
        )
